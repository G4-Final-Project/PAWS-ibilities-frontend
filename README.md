## Text Message

Once a pet is assigned to a child the child will recieve a text message to the phone number assigned by the parent. This number will further be used to send notifications of the pets needs such as:

* When a pet is hungry
* when a pet needs a bath
* When a pet needs play time

The text will also send the child a link to the Pet View where the child will perform these tasks.
